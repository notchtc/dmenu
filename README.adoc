IMPORTANT:: Install https://github.com/uditkarode/libxft-bgra[libxft-bgra] to not have crashes when emojis are displayed.

This is my simple personal build of https://tools.suckless.org/dmenu[dmenu].

== Requirements
In order to build dmenu you need the Xlib header files.

== Patches
- https://tools.suckless.org/dmenu/patches/fuzzymatch[fuzzymatch]
- https://tools.suckless.org/dmenu/patches/fuzzyhighlight[fuzzyhighlight]
- https://tools.suckless.org/dmenu/patches/xresources-alt[xresources-alt]

== Installation
Clone the repository and enter the directory.
[source,shell]
git clone https://github.com/notchtc/dmenu
cd dmenu

Edit config.mk to match your local setup (dmenu is installed into
the /usr/local namespace by default).

Afterwards enter the following command to build and install dmenu
(if necessary as root):
[source,shell]
make clean install

== Running dmenu
See the man page for details.
